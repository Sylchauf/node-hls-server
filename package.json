  "description": "Easy to use and configure HLS server, inspired by hls-server and node-media-server. The main reason is to develop a lighter and reduced version of node-media-server, only dedicated to HLS streamings. Hls-server does this but configuration and use its a bit more complex, my aim is to automatize it and simplify, getting the best of nms and hls-server.",
